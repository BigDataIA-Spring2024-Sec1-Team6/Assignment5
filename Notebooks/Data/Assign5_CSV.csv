Industry and Company Analysis (2018),"2018
 Curriculum",Level II,"This reading explores industry and company analysis with a focus on how analysts use industry information and corporate disclosures to forecast a company’s future financial results. Financial forecasts are the basis for fundamental equity valuation based on discounted cash flows and/or market multiples. An effective forecast model must be based on a thorough understanding of a company’s business, management, strategy, external environment, and historical results. Thus an analyst begins with a review of the company and its environment—its industry, key products, strategic position, management, competitors, suppliers, and customers. Using this information, an analyst identifies key revenue and cost drivers and assesses the likely impact of relevant trends, such as economic conditions and technological developments. An analyst’s understanding of the fundamental drivers of the business and an assessment of future events provides a basis for developing inputs to the forecast model. This reading begins with an overview of developing a forecast model. Section 2 describes the general approach to forecasting each component of the income statement (revenue, operating costs, and non-operating costs), balance sheet, and cash flow statement. The next sections develop special topics: Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 describe, respectively, the impact of competitive factors on prices and costs; the effects of inflation and deflation; technological developments; long-term forecasting; and building a company model. Section 8 presents conclusions and a summary.","compare top-down, bottom-up, and hybrid approaches for developing inputs to equity valuation models; compare “growth relative to GDP growth” and “market growth and market share” approaches to forecasting revenue; evaluate whether economies of scale are present in an industry by analyzing operating margins and sales levels; forecast the following costs: cost of goods sold, selling general and administrative costs, financing costs, and income taxes; describe approaches to balance sheet modeling; describe the relationship between return on invested capital and competitive advantage; explain how competitive factors affect prices and costs; judge the competitive position of a company based on a Porter’s five forces analysis; explain how to forecast industry and company sales and costs when they are subject to price inflation or deflation; evaluate the effects of technological developments on demand, selling prices, costs, and margins; explain considerations in the choice of an explicit forecast horizon; explain an analyst’s choices in developing projections beyond the short-term forecast horizon; demonstrate the development of a sales-based pro forma company model.",https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/2018/industry-and-company-analysis,No PDF link found
Free Cash Flow Valuation (2018),"2018
 Curriculum",Level II,"Discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation views the intrinsic value of a security as the
present value of its expected future cash flows. When applied to dividends, the DCF
model is the discounted dividend approach or dividend discount model (DDM). This
reading extends DCF analysis to value a company and its equity securities by valuing
free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE). Whereas dividends
are the cash flows actually paid to stockholders, free cash flows are the cash
flows available for distribution to shareholders. Unlike dividends, FCFF and FCFE are not readily available data. Analysts need to
compute these quantities from available financial information, which requires a clear
understanding of free cash flows and the ability to interpret and use the information
correctly. Forecasting future free cash flows is also a rich and demanding exercise.
The analyst’s understanding of a company’s financial statements, its operations, its
financing, and its industry can pay real “dividends” as he or she addresses that task.
Many analysts consider free cash flow models to be more useful than DDMs in practice.
Free cash flows provide an economically sound basis for valuation. Analysts like to use free cash flow as the return (either FCFF or FCFE) whenever
one or more of the following conditions is present: Common equity can be valued directly by using FCFE or indirectly by first using a
FCFF model to estimate the value of the firm and then subtracting the value of noncommon-stock
capital (usually debt) from FCFF to arrive at an estimate of the value
of equity. The purpose of this reading is to develop the background required to use
the FCFF or FCFE approaches to value a company’s equity. Section 2 defines the concepts of free cash flow to the firm and free cash flow to
equity and then presents the two valuation models based on discounting of FCFF and
FCFE. We also explore the constant-growth models for valuing FCFF and FCFE, which
are special cases of the general models, in this section. After reviewing the FCFF and
FCFE valuation process in Section 2, we turn in Section 3 to the vital task of calculating and forecasting FCFF and FCFE. Section 4 explains multistage free cash flow
valuation models and presents some of the issues associated with their application.
Analysts usually value operating assets and nonoperating assets separately and then
combine them to find the total value of the firm, an approach described in Section 5.","compare the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow
to equity (FCFE) approaches to valuation; explain the ownership perspective implicit in the FCFE approach; explain the appropriate adjustments to net income, earnings
before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and cash flow from
operations (CFO) to calculate FCFF and FCFE; calculate FCFF and FCFE; describe approaches for forecasting FCFF and FCFE; compare the FCFE model and dividend discount models; explain how dividends, share repurchases, share issues, and
changes in leverage may affect future FCFF and FCFE; evaluate the use of net income and EBITDA as proxies for cash
flow in valuation; explain the single-stage (stable-growth), two-stage, and
three-stage FCFF and FCFE models and select and justify the
appropriate model given a company’s characteristics; estimate a company’s value using the appropriate free cash flow
model(s); explain the use of sensitivity analysis in FCFF and FCFE
valuations; describe approaches for calculating the terminal value in a
multistage valuation model; evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or
undervalued based on a free cash flow valuation model.",https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/2018/free-cash-flow-valuation,No PDF link found
Residual Income Valuation (2018),"2018
 Curriculum",Level II,"Residual income models of equity value have become widely recognized tools in both investment practice and research. Conceptually, residual income is net income less a charge (deduction) for common shareholders’ opportunity cost in generating net income. It is the residual or remaining income after considering the costs of all of a company’s capital. The appeal of residual income models stems from a shortcoming of traditional accounting. Specifically, although a company’s income statement includes a charge for the cost of debt capital in the form of interest expense, it does not include a charge for the cost of equity capital. A company can have positive net income but may still not be adding value for shareholders if it does not earn more than its cost of equity capital. Residual income models explicitly recognize the costs of all the capital used in generating income. As an economic concept, residual income has a long history, dating back to Alfred Marshall in the late 1800s.1 As far back as the 1920s, General Motors used the concept in evaluating business segments.2 More recently, residual income has received renewed attention and interest, sometimes under names such as economic profit, abnormal earnings, or economic value added. Although residual income concepts have been used in a variety of contexts, including the measurement of internal corporate performance, this reading will focus on the residual income model for estimating the intrinsic value of common stock. Among the questions we will study to help us apply residual income models are the following: The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 develops the concept of residual income, introduces the use of residual income in valuation, and briefly presents alternative measures used in practice. Section 3 presents the residual income model and illustrates its use in valuing common stock. This section also shows practical applications, including the single-stage (constant-growth) residual income model and a multistage residual income model. Section 4 describes the relative strengths and weaknesses of residual income valuation compared to other valuation methods. Section 5 addresses accounting issues in the use of residual income valuation. The final section summarizes the reading and practice problems conclude. 1 Alfred Marshall, Book Two: Some Fundamental Notions, Chapter 4, “Income, Capital,” in Principles of Economics (London; Macmillan and Co., Ltd., 1890).

Market-Based Valuation: Price and Enterprise Value Multiples (2018),"2018
 Curriculum",Level II,"Among the most familiar and widely used valuation tools are price and enterprise value multiples. Price multiples are ratios of a stock’s market price to some measure of fundamental value per share. Enterprise value multiples, by contrast, relate the total market value of all sources of a company’s capital to a measure of fundamental value for the entire company. The intuition behind price multiples is that investors evaluate the price of a share of stock—judge whether it is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued—by considering what a share buys in terms of per share earnings, net assets, cash flow or some other measure of value (stated on a per share basis). The intuition behind enterprise value multiples is similar; investors evaluate the market value of an entire enterprise relative to the amount of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), sales, or operating cash flow it generates. As valuation indicators (measures or indicators of value), multiples have the appealing qualities of simplicity in use and ease in communication. A multiple summarizes in a single number the relationship between the market value of a company’s stock (or of its total capital) and some fundamental quantity, such as earnings, sales, or book value (owners’ equity based on accounting values). Among the questions we will study in this reading for answers that will help in making correct use of multiples as valuation tools are the following: Multiples may be viewed as valuation indicators relating to individual securities. Another type of valuation indicator used in securities selection is momentum indicators. They typically relate either price or a fundamental (such as earnings) to the time series of its own past values or, in some cases, to its expected value. The logic behind the use of momentum indicators is that such indicators may provide infor-mation on future patterns of returns over some time horizon. Because the purpose of momentum indicators is to identify potentially rewarding investment opportunities, they can be viewed as a class of valuation indicators with a focus that is different from and complementary to the focus of price and enterprise value multiples. This reading is organized as follows. In Section 2, we put the use of price and enterprise value multiples in an economic context and present certain themes common to the use of any price or enterprise value multiple. Section 3 presents price multiples; a subsection is devoted to each multiple. The treatment of each multiple follows a common format: usage considerations, the relationship of the multiple to investors’ expectations about fundamentals, and using the multiple in valuation based on comparables. Section 4 presents enterprise value multiples and is organized similarly to Section 3. Section 5 presents international considerations in using multiples. A treatment of momentum indicators follows in Section 6. Section 7 discusses several practical issues that arise in using valuation indicators. We then summarize the reading, and the reading concludes with practice problems.","distinguish between the method of comparables and the method based on forecasted fundamentals as approaches to using price multiples in valuation, and explain economic rationales for each approach; calculate and interpret a justified price multiple; describe rationales for and possible drawbacks to using alternative price multiples and dividend yield in valuation; calculate and interpret alternative price multiples and dividend yield; calculate and interpret underlying earnings, explain methods of normalizing earnings per share (EPS), and calculate normalized EPS; explain and justify the use of earnings yield (E/P); describe fundamental factors that influence alternative price multiples and dividend yield; calculate and interpret the justified price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), price-to-book ratio (P/B), and price-to-sales ratio (P/S) for a stock, based on forecasted fundamentals; calculate and interpret a predicted P/E, given a cross-sectional regression on fundamentals, and explain limitations to the cross-sectional regression methodology; evaluate a stock by the method of comparables and explain the importance of fundamentals in using the method of comparables; calculate and interpret the P/E-to-growth ratio (PEG) and explain its use in relative valuation; calculate and explain the use of price multiples in determining terminal value in a multistage discounted cash flow (DCF) model; explain alternative definitions of cash flow used in price and enterprise value (EV) multiples and describe limitations of each definition; calculate and interpret EV multiples and evaluate the use of EV/EBITDA; explain sources of differences in cross-border valuation comparisons; describe momentum indicators and their use in valuation; explain the use of the arithmetic mean, the harmonic mean, the weighted harmonic mean, and the median to describe the central tendency of a group of multiples; revaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on comparisons of multiples.",https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/2018/market-based-valuation-price-and-enterprise,No PDF link found
